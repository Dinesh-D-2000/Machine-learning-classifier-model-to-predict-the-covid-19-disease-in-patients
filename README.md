# Machine-learning-classifier-model-to-predict-the-covid-19-disease-in-patients
The goal of this project is to deploy a machine learning classifier model using deep neural network to predict the covid-19 disease in patients. The deep neural network model built in Matlab is exported as a simulink model. The trained model is then tested for various inputs in MATLAB live script. This project can be used by the healthcare professional to detect covid-19 in patients and to understand various symptoms that contribute to the disease.

As the WHO has declared the Coronavirus pandemic as a health emergency, researchers have been provided open access to data related to the epidemic. The dataset was collected from kaggle.com and it has 5434 Ã— 21 rows of columns. This dataset contains 20 input variables which are the symptoms in the prediction of covid-19, as well as one target class attribute that defines if covid-19 is found or not.
